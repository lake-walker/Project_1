# Project_1
Pay to Win

For this project I was given an open ended opportunity to analyze the European Soccer Transfer Market
I looked through several different databases to gain my data

Transfer Data
Github user ewenme compiled database of transfer data dating back 28 years
Team and Player Statistics
API-FOOTBALL
Foootball Reference
Cleanup
  Used Europeâ€™s top 5 leagues (England, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain) over the last 5 years
  Brought in team and player stats from API-FOOTBALL
  Advanced stats for the last 3 years applied to the top 20 transfers over that time period

Full post analysis can be found in the analysis.txt
